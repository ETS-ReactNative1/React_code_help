# Code Help
Project Creator: Segun Subair

**Overview**
 Code help is an app that uses an API to fetch code syntax based on the question asked by the user. Code help also uses the Mdn API to provide more technical explanations to the user's questions and a youtube API to provide a visual guide to better simplify harder coding questions. Users have the option to save answers to be viewed offline or just copy the displayed syntax to their clipboard


**Tech Stack**
React
React Native
Expo Go
Mdn API
Youtube API
Code Grepper 
PWA

**Implementation**
 Code help went through multiple implementations. The first implementation was Html, Css, and javascript app with my focus on making the app mobile friendly used PWA to make code help installable as a bookmark. The second implementation was as a React app introducing Mdn to help with the answer while also having the ability to save answers and view them offline. The third implementation was as a React native app this was challenging but I was able to implement a youtube feature and install the app natively on ios.


**Key Decisions**
Technologies
  The technologies I used were based on what I had learned at the time I was making the project. The first implementation of the app was when I was still in Bootcamp learning amount fetch and I decided to make a side project. I went with using a PWA route because it makes it possible to install the app on my phone. I thought about using swift to build the app but I decided to use React native because I had previously learned React at Marcy labs 

**Hits & Misses**
The implementation of the react app went smoothly because I knew what functionality I was introducing to the app
I am proud of how useful the app has been since I made it. The youtube and Mdn features have been highly useful even for complicated questions
The first implementation was my proudest moment finishing the app with the ability to save answers to the local storage making it a PWA app and also figuring out how to make a sidebar for easy access to the features was an amazing experience.
The first implementation proved to be very difficult because I was challenging myself to do better and introduce daring features at the time
I wished I had a plan before heading into the project. I was making a lot of mistakes and fixing them but would have been able to identify most of the mistakes quickly if I had a plan 
I wished I had started with just a react native setup at first instead of using expo wish made it difficult for me to expand the project to a mac application because I used some of Expo methods that were not supported on mac
